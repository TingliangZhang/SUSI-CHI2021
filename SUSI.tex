\begin{abstract}
  SUSI GENE is an egg-shaped interactive robot that designed for mental disordered people. It can be placed on the back of  a smart phone.
  SUSI is a safe, friendly and portable tool to prevent depression disorder and assist patients with mental disorders (such as depression disorder). It help people by increasing self-awareness, assisting treatment and seeking help. 
  It encourages people who are experiencing emotional problems to expose and face their inner vulnerability in an appropriate way, so as to help them vent emotions and carry out cognitive reappraisal.
